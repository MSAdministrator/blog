Group Policy order can be confusing. To understand how exactly Windows applies one GPO (Group Policy Object) versus another, you can use the "LSD OU" rule.

You should always ask yourself two questions when dealing with Group Policy:
<ol>
	<li>Where are you (local, site, domain, or organizational unit)?</li>
	<li>What are you (computer or user)?</li>
</ol>

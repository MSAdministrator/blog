In my last post, I explained [how to install docker and how to run containers](https://msadministrator.com/2018/01/04/install-docker-and-run-containers-on-windows/). Today, we will walk through creating a Docker container using a Dockerfile.

A Dockerfile (no file extension) is a definition file that will build and run a container. That container can be a simple Microsoft IIS web application or Python/Flask application or a simple build/reporting service. A definition file helps us with our operational tasks, especially when we are building services or scripts for the repeatable tasks we face on a daily basis.

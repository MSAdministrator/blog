Hello Everyone, in the following few weeks I will creating several new posts about setting MDT 2013 on Windows Server 2012 R2 to enable you to image your Dell OptiPlex &amp; Lattitude machines. This will be similar to my MDT 2012 Update 1 Guide but a bit different as well. I hope you enjoy!

To Start things off, you need to download the following pieces of software:

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40796">MDT 2013</a>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39982">ADK for Windows 8.1</a>
Windows 8.1 ISO/DVD
Windows 7 ISO/DVD
<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/enterprise-client/w/wiki/5029.winpe-5-0-driver-cab.aspx">WinPE 5.0 Driver CAB - From Dell</a>

I will continue on my next post. Â MDT 2013: Installing ADK

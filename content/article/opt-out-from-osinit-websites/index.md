Preventing Identity Theft & Opting Out of Marketing Sites:


📞 Consider freezing your credit, which prevents creditors from accessing your credit report. (It also prevents credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name, but you will receive a pin to unfreeze your credit, if needed.) You will need to provide personal information such as your name, address, date of birth, and social security number to freeze your credit. While you can sometimes initiate this online, it’s better to do it by phone. Fees for freezing your credit vary by state. To freeze your credit, contact:

Equifax:  1 (800) 349-9960, https://www.freeze.equifax.com/ 
Experian: 1 (888) 397‑3742, https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/credit-education/preventing-fraud/security-freeze/ 
TransUnion: 1 (888) 909-8872, https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze
Innovis: 1 (800) 540-2505, https://www.innovis.com/personal/securityFreeze 
Explore any privacy options offered by your state’s motor vehicle department. 

Contact your home and mobile phone companies to see if they offer privacy options, such as not listing your number on caller ID or allowing you to opt out of sales of phone numbers. 

Consider opting out of direct marketing and telemarketing. This list, compiled by Griffin Boyce, has a lot of information on doing so: https://github.com/glamrock/data-brokers/blob/master/data-brokers.md. A good place to start is to opt out at the Direct Marketing Association .https://dmachoice.thedma.org/register.php

Amazon SQS is a flexible queue service that has many uses cases, from scalable web applications and processing systems to inter-application communications. This is useful if you need to process lots of data at once or have threads or workers to do a specific action to a large pool of data.

With the explosion of use cases for PowerShell and Docker in production systems, you can easily scale using queue systems like Amazon SQS. SQS is beneficial when your service or application has job workers that need to perform actions based on a large pool of data.

At Swimlane, we love to automate but we also love building and sharing open-source software (OSS) to help security teams. We are proud to announce that we have released a new open-source project called elk-tls-docker to make it easier for you to test and deploy Elastic Stack by automating the creation of several Elastic open-source software solutions.

Elk-tls-docker assists with setting up aand creating an Elastic Stack using either self-signed certificates or using Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates (using SWAG). This project was built so that you can test and use built-in features under Elastic Security, like detections, signals, cases, Elastic Endpoint and other features.

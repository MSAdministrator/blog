Recently I gave a presentation at MORENet's 2015 Annual Conference about "Securing Windows with Group Policy".  This presentation was part of their "Advanced" technology track, and really focused on looking at the current permission levels of your users and deciding if they really need those rights/permissions.

I hope some people find these slides useful or at least a good reference point.  If you have any questions about these slides then please do not hesitate to contact me by leaving a comment below.

NOTE: MORENet's conference is focused on technology and educational initiatives affecting K-12 &amp; Higher Education within the State of Missouri.

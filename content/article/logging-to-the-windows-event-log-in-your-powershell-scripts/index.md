As I discussed in my <a href="https://4sysops.com/archives/standardize-powershell-logging-with-my-write-logentry-function/">previous post</a>, you can log information to a file, but sometimes you may want to log to the Windows Event Log. Â To log to the Windows Event Log, you will need to use the following cmdlets:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.0/microsoft.powershell.management/new-eventlog">New-EventLog</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.0/microsoft.powershell.management/write-eventlog">Write-EventLog</a></li>
</ul>

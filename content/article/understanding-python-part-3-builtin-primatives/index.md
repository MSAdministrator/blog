## Introduction

Whether you are new to Python or not, ensuring you understand the basics will help you along the way to becoming a Python expert.

Please see the following series of posts:

## Built-in Primitives

Python has several built-in "features", like functions and primitives and data types. For example, lets look at a few:

```python
print
enumerate
input
dir
```

The built-in `print` function does exactly what you think. It will output your desired text to your console. This is often used to let the builder/consumer of your code know where it is in the code itself. There are better, more appropriate ways of doing this, but for the beginners `print` is the go to choice.

You can manage Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) cloud storage solution with help of the Amazon Web Services <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-welcome.html">AWS Tools for PowerShell</a>. In this post, I will introduce you to the cmdlets that allow you access S3.

To follow this guide, you will need an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html">AWS account and access keys</a>. The AWS Tools for PowerShell run on Windows XP or later and PowerShell 2.0 or later. If you want to try the AWS Tools for PowerShell Core, you must have PowerShell 5.1 or later installed.

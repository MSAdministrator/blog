Simple Notification Service (SNS) from Amazon Web Services (AWS) can work in conjunction with AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS), Lambda Functions, HTTP APIs/endpoints, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), and so on. As PowerShell continues to gain attraction with IT professionals around the globe, you can use SNS along with other services to create powerful applications to help your business win.

Amazon SNS lets your application deliver notifications to additional services or applications, depending on your use case. SNS is becoming more and more common in microservice architecture designs around the globe. If your application needs to communicate with multiple endpoints or you need multiple applications to communicate to a central service, you should consider AWS SNS.

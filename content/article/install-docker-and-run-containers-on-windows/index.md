Docker is an operating-system level virtualization technology that allows you to isolate applications in so-called containers without the overhead of conventional virtual machines. In this post, you'll learn how to install Docker on Windows and run your first containers.

Docker allows developers building a specific functionality (and all of its dependencies) into a small reproducible environment. This has evolved over time by enabling the ability to create small microservices that do one thing and do it well. I like to think of containers as a Windows Service installed without the need for the entire operating system.

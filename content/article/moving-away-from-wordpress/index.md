Hello Everyone, I have decided this past weekend to final move completely away from WordPress for my blog; and I'm 100% excited for this transition! I have decided to use GitHub Pages for my new blog.

I plan on migrating content to this new locaton, but in the meantime if you find any missing content that you have seen previously then please let me know and I will get it moved over ASAP.

I am hoping with this new layout that I will be able to automate both the creation and deployment of any new content.  Yes, I will be writing a blog about my experience in the coming weeks.

Here's to the next few years of blogging and sharing knowledge with the community.

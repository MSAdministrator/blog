Everyone's path in the world is different, unique.  We all have past experiences that mold who we are as an individual.  No matter the career or where we want to go, it is import to reflect on our path so that we can set goals for our future.  If you are technical person, or not, it doesn't matter.  The important thing is to remember that we are responsible for the lives we want, and no one else.

I am going to share some personal tidbits about my path, so that hopefully it helps others in a similar situation.

Project Management, Incident Response, Developer, all of these have one stage that relate to each other - retrospectives.  Retrospective's are import so that we can identify where things went great, okay, or could be approved upon.  This is my career's retrospective.

I grew up in a small river town in Missouri.  My parents were in the middle class, some would say upper-middle class.  My parents both worked all their lives, always wanting to make sure that my sister and I had what we needed, as well as what we wanted.  My mom and dad are, and still are, the hardest working individuals I have ever met.

My technology retrospective started when I was 14/15.  Just like every kid that grew up  in the early nineties, we had video games up to this point but my true first experience with technology was around eight and ninth grade.  My parents bought us a IBM computer.  Let me tell you, this thing probably cost them a couple thousand dollars, and at that time that was quite a bit for my family.  Of course, I played video games but mostly ignored it.

During the summer break between leaving middle school and joining high-school, I didn't really have many (close) friends so I began surfing the internet and joining chat rooms.  This is where my path starts.

The first thing I remember that really opened my eyes was that I could go to a website and I could view this strange language underneath it.  I had no clue what I was looking at, but I spent the entire summer modifying it line by line to figure out how it worked.  I had no clue there were books or other materials that I could learn from, I honestly just tinkered with it to make it look how I wanted it to.  It was amazing!

After that summer, I didn't spend much time on computers except for my computer classes in high-school and the occasional practical joke in our computer labs.

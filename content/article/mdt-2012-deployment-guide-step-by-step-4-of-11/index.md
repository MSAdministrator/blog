<h2>4.          Importing an OS Image</h2>
The Operating Systems section of MDT lists all of the Operating Systems which are available to deploy from a Deployment Share.  The deployment itself is controlled by a Task Sequence but the operating system source files need to be available.

&nbsp;

Simply right-click on Operating Systems on the left and Import your Windows 7 source media from either DVD or a network share.  If you are planning to deploy both 32 and 64 bit versions, import both!  You can also import Windows XP, Vista, Server 2003,
                    2003R2,
                    2008 and 2008R2 for deployment…

&nbsp;

Once you’ve created a custom WIM file from your reference PC, you can import this in exactly the same way.
